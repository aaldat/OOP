<br>
All classes must be located in package <b>supermarket</b>. 
The main class is <b>Supermarket</b>. 
Class <i>TestApp</i> in package <i>example</i> contains examples and
provides the main test cases (not all). You are advised to read the requirements 
and look into the corresponding sections of <i>TestApp</i>.
Please remember that the efficiency of data structure is evaluated.
<p>
Exceptions are thrown through class <b>SPException</b>;

<h2>R1: Categories, products, prices </h2>

Methods <b>int addProducts (String categoryName, String ProductNames, String ProductPrices) </b>
allows adding new products defining the relative category.
The methods accepts the name of a category, the names of the products (for the category)
separated by commas, and the relative prices (double) separated by commas.

The method throws and exception if the name of the category has ben already defined
in a previous call to the method itself, the name of a product appeared in a previous category,
or the number of prices is different from the number of products.

The result is the number of products that have been added.
For instance, an invocation that returns 5 is the following:
<i>addProducts ("cat1", "pa1,pa2,pa3,qa1,qa2", "10.00,5.23,12.45,4.00,15.50");</i>

<p>
The method <b>double getPrice (String productName)</b> 
returns the price of a product identified by its name or
throws an exception id the product is not defined.
<p>

IThe method <b>mostExpensiveProductPerCategory()</b> 
returns, for each category, the name of the product with
the highest prices (assume it is unique); categories must be sorted alphabetically.
<p>



<h2>R2 Discount types: by category, by product</h2>

Initially the dicount percentage for a category or a product is 0.
<p>
The method <b>void setDiscount(String category, int percentage)</b> 
defines the discount percentage for all products of the given category.
The method throws an exception if the category is not defined or the
percentage is above 40. The percentage can be 0.
The method can be called multiple times on the same category,
so at different times there may be different discounts.
<p>

Method <b>getDiscountHistoryForCategory (String category)</b> 
returns the sequence of discount percentages in the order they have
been defined (including the initial 0 percentage). 
<p>

The method <b>void setDiscount(int percentage, String... productNames)</b>
defines the given discount percentage for all listed products.   
<p>

The two <i>setDiscount()</i> methods defined above can be invoked multiple times in
any order, thus repeatedly changing the discount percentage of a product.
For instance it is possible to define the discount for a category and then change 
the discount for a few specific products.
The effective discount values the one corresponding to the lates invocation (of either method).  
<p>

Method <b>getDiscountHistoryForProduct (String productName)</b> 
returns the sequence of discount percentages in the order they
have been defined (including the initial one, that is 0).
<p>



<h2>R3 Points card </h2>
 
With the method <b>int issuePointsCard (String name, String  DateOfBirth)</b>,
given the name and the birth date (with format <i>"20210706"</i>) of a client,
it is possible to issues a point card, tha has a progressive code (the return value)
starting from 1000 (inclusive).
The method throws and exception if the pair name and birth date has already been
used to get another card.
The card is used to collect points relative to purchases as described in next requirement.
The card keeps both the currently available points, that is those that can be redeemed 
during purchases (that are thus decremented), and the total points
that is those collected through all the purchases. 
 <p>

The method <b>void fromPointsToDiscounts (String points, String discounts)</b> 
defines a sorted map (points-discount) (<i>SortedMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt;</i>)
that associates the points to the discount that can be obtained.
The method throws an exception id the number of points is different from the number of discounts.
<br>
For instance, the call <i>fromPointsToDiscounts ("50,100,150,200", "2,5,7,10")</i>
defines that by redeeming 50 points a customer can get a 2 euros discount,
100 points gives a 5 euros discount, etc.
<p>

Method <b>getMapPointsDiscounts()</b> returns the map.
<p>

Methodo <b>int getDiscountFromPoints(int points)</b> 
returns the discount relative to the given amount of points
or returns 0 if the precise number of points does not appear in the map.
For instance with the above definition, 80 points corresponds to discount 0.



<h2>R4 Purchases</h2>

Methodo <b>int addPurchase (int pointsCardCode, int pointsRedeemed, String productNames)</b> 
generates a purchase. The first argument indicates the customer's point card,
the second provides the number of points the client wants to redeem to get a discount,
the latter provides the list of purchased products.
The method returns the purchase code, that is a progressive integer number starting at 100 (inclusive). 
<p>
The method applies the current effective discount percentages (that might be 0) associated to the products.
In addition it can apply the discount for the redeemed points, only if the 
number of points correspond to a discount, otherwise that amount is ignored.
The method throws an exception if the number of points is greater than the
currently available points on the card.
The possibly redeemed points are subtracted from the balance of the currently available points in the card.  
<p>

The method eventually computes the number of points obtained with the purchase:
they are given by the total proces (after all discounts) rounded (<i>Math.round</i>). 
Such points are added to the current balance and to the total of the card.
<p>

Method <b>double getPurchasePrice (int purchaseCode)</b>
returns the total price of the given purchase.
<p>

Method <b>double getPurchaseDiscount (int purchaseCode)</b>
return the total discount applied for the given purchase,
which is given by the discount on the products plus the possible
discount from redeemed points.
<p>

The two latter methods throw an exception in case of undefined purchase code.
<p>

Method <b>int getCurrentPoints (int pointsCardCode)</b> 
returns the currently available points of the given card
(accumulated points minus redeemed points).
The method throws an exception if the point card is not defined.
<p>

Method <b>int getTotalPoints (int pointsCardCode)</b>
returns the total points accumulated for the given point card.
The method throws an exception if the point card is not defined.



<h2>R5 Statistics</h2>

Method <b>pointsCardsPerTotalPoints()</b> 
returns a map that groups the point cards codes by total amount of points.
The total points as well ass the codes are sorted.
Point cards with 0 points are excluded.
<p>

Method <b>customersPerCategory()</b> 
produces a map that associates each category name with the
name of the customers that purchased products in those categories.
The name of the categories are sorted, the names of the clients
are sorted and not duplicate.
<p>

Method <b>productsPerDiscount()</b> 
generates a map that associates the highest discount percentage (from the complete history)
of the products, excluding those having 0 as highest percentage.
The map groups the name of the products by the corresponding percentage.
Names are sorted alphabetically, while percentages are sorted in decreasing order.



<h2>R6 Desk interface </h2>

Class <b>Supermarket</b> 
must provide a set of methods that can be called from another application
that supports the supermarket desk that manages the receipts.

<p>
When a new receipt must be started (e.g. a new customer arrives at the desk)
the method <b>newReceipt()</b> is called: it returns a new unique code
(a progressive number starting at 0) 

<p>
To add the point card of the caustomer (in order to collect  and possibly
redeem points), method <b>receiptAddCard(int receiptCode, int PointsCard)</b>
is called. The method throws an exception if the code of the receipt or the
point card are not valid.
The receipt code is considered valid if it has been returned in a previous
call to method <i>newReceipt()</i> and if it has not been closed with
a call to method <i>closeReceipt()</i> (described below).

<p>
After a card has been linked to the receip, method 
<b>receiptGetPoints(int receiptCode)</b>
can be used to retrieve the currently available points.
The method throws an exception if the code of the receipt is not valid
or if no point card is associated to the receipt.

<p>
Method <b>receiptAddProduct(int receiptCode, String product)</b>
adds a new product to the receipt.
The method throws an exception if the code of the receipt or the 
name of the product are not valid.

<p>
Method <b>receiptGetTotal(int receiptCode)</b> 
returns the total of the receipt.
The total is computed as the sum of the prices of the product added to
the receipt up to this moment, after applying the effective discounts.
(suppose discounts cannot change during the operations on the receipt).
The method throws an exception if the code of the receipt is not valid.

<p>
Method <b>receiptSetRedeem(int receiptCode, int points)</b>
allows redeeming points from the point card to get a discount.
The method throws an exception if the code of the receipt is not valid,
if no point card is associated to the receipt,
if the amount of points is greater than those currently available on the card,
or it the amount does not correspond to any discount.
The discount is applied to the total of the receipt.


<p>
The receipt can be closed (when all products have been added and 
the customer has to pay) by calling the method <b>closeReceipt(int receiptCode)</b>.

This method behaves like the method <i>addPurchase()</i> 
(defined in R4 above), considering all the products that have been
added to the receipt and the possible points redeemed from the point card. 

The method returns the purchase code (as defined for the method <i>addPurchase()</i>).

The method throws an exception if the code of the receipt is not valid.
