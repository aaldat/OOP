<p>
Extend, inside class <b>UniversityExt</b> the 
<a href="Requirements.html">functions already implemented</a>
in class <i>University</i>.
<p>
The class <b>UniversityExt</b> extends class <i>University</i>.

<h2 id="R5">R5. Exams</h2>
<p>
Students can take the exams for the courses in which they have been enrolled. 
The grade for an exam can be registered through the method <b>exam()</b> that accepts as arguments the ID 
of the student, course code and a grade (integer 0-30).
</p><p>
To get the average grade for a student, the method <b>studentAvg()</b> 
is used. It accepts as argument the ID of the student. If the student took at least one exam 
it returns a String of the following format <i>"Student STUDENT_ID : AVG_GRADE"</i>. 
Otherwise, it  returns <i>"Student STUDENT_ID hasn't taken any exams"</i>.
</p><p>
It is possible to get the average grades of all students that took the exam for a given course, 
method <b>courseAvg()</b> accepting as argument the course code can be used for this purpose. 
The format is the following: <i>"The average for the course COURSE_TITLE is: COURSE_AVG"</i>, 
if at least one student took the exam for that course. 
If this is not the case, the method should return <i>"No student has taken the exam in COURSE_TITLE"</i>.
</p>
<ul class="hint">
<li>It can be safely assumed that if a student takes an exam, 
it has been previously enrolled to the corresponding course.
</ul>

<h2 id="R6">R6. Student award</h2>
<p>
The university has decided to award the best students for their hard-work and effort. 
The method <b>topThreeStudents()</b> is used to retrieve information for helping the
committee to award the price(s).
<p> 
The students' score is evaluated as the average grade of the exams they've taken. 
To take into account the number of exams taken and not only the grades, 
special bonus is assigned on top of the average grade:
the number of taken exams divided by the number of courses the student is enrolled to, 
multiplied by 10 is added. 
<p>
The method returns a string with the information about the three students with the
highest score.
The students appear one per row (rows are terminated by a new-line character <i>'\n'</i>) 
and each one of them is formatted as: <i>"STUDENT_FIRSTNAME STUDENT_LASTNAME : SCORE"</i>.
</p>

<ul class="hint">
<li>Assume that there are no ties.
</ul>
